## Description

This project is a Todo list app that also enables the user to raise his pet cat with the experience points they earn through completing their todos. They can earn money through finishing tasks, buy food and decorations for their pet cats and raise their cats' levels. There is also a ranking for the top 10 cat raisers and top 10 task-completors. 

This application has both Android App and also web-end App. It is also connected to a MongoDB database, which I (Estee) was mainly in charge of developing. Users can register an account with their emails, log in and log out, and change their passwords. Users can add, delete, edit and complete/archive a task, and the tasks have deadlines which expires and causes the cat level to drop. The web-end front end is developed with css and html, and the Android front end is developed with Java. Both the web and Android are developed on node.js.
